This course is designed to better prepare professionals entering the IT field.
Specifically, a field where servers, web apps and infrastructure will be core to
business needs. COMP 3104 will provide a hands-on experience through the
implementation of tried, tested and true DevOps technologies. 

DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an
 organizationâ€™s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving 
 products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure 
 management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their
 customers and compete more effectively in the market.
