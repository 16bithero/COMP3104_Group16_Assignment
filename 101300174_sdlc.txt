Reports generated by DevOps tools provide business insights and enhance the visibility in SDLC.
By managing the value from end to end, DevOps increase the delivery velocity systematically.
Most software developers benefit from the branching tools provided by DevOps
SDLC works by lowering the cost of software development while simultaneously improving quality and shortening production time. SDLC achieves these apparently divergent goals by following a plan that removes the typical pitfalls of software development projects. That plan starts by evaluating existing systems for deficiencies.

Next, it defines the requirements of the new system. It then creates the software through the stages of analysis,
 planning, design, development, testing, and deployment. By anticipating costly mistakes like failing to ask the
  end-user or client for feedback, SLDC can eliminate redundant rework and after-the-fact fixes.

Itâ€™s also important to know that there is a strong focus on the testing phase. As the SDLC is a repetitive
 methodology, you have to ensure code quality at every cycle. Many organizations tend to spend few efforts
  on testing while a stronger focus on testing can save them a lot of rework, time, and money. Be smart and 
  write the right types of tests.
