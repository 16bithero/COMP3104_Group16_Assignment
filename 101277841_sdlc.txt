What is DevOps in Software Development Cycle?

If we take a look at it, companies had two teams managing softwares, which are the development and operations team, with
Development team writing the software and Operations to test the code making sure it runs without errors before deployment.
This went on until they realized it's a bad idea since there are two separate teams working on a software, which leads to 
problems since ops have no one to rely on but the documentation whenever they encounter a problem. This is where DevOps 
comes in, merging two teams together, so the developers who write the program are also the one testing, supporting, 
and deploying it, reducing time in cycle development.

How does it impact SDLC? Why is it important?

As mentioned before, learning DevOps significantly reduce development cycle time in projects. 
Since the software is handled by one team, failures and errors are monitored and fixed often compared to deploying 
and app with separate teams managing it. Deploying an app with little to no programming errors also increases the 
deployment success rate of a product. This way, the apps and software deployments are faster and more efficient, 
significantly improving a product's quality, and the company more succesful.
